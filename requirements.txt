# HDMI USB Capture Python Dependencies
# 
# This script primarily uses Python standard library modules:
# - subprocess: for running system commands (v4l2-ctl, gst-launch-1.0, etc.)
# - argparse: for command-line argument parsing
# - pathlib: for file path operations
# - re: for regular expression matching
# - threading: for background window monitoring
# - os, sys, time, signal: for system operations
#
# No external PyPI packages are required.
# However, system packages must be installed:
# - gstreamer1.0-tools
# - gstreamer1.0-plugins-base
# - gstreamer1.0-plugins-good
# - v4l-utils (for v4l2-ctl)
# - wmctrl (for window positioning)
# - x11-utils (for xwininfo)
